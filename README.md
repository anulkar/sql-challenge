# SQL Homework - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

## Data Modeling & Engineering
* Designed a PotsgreSQL database that will store employee records for a company.
  * Inspected the [CSVs](https://github.com/anulkar/sql-challenge/tree/master/EmployeeSQL/data) and sketched out an [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://github.com/anulkar/sql-challenge/blob/master/EmployeeSQL/images/Employee_DB_ERD.png) for the DB using [QuickDBD](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).
  * Wrote a DB script to create a [SQL table schema](https://github.com/anulkar/sql-challenge/blob/master/EmployeeSQL/employee_db_schema.sql) for each of the six CSV data files and imported each file into the corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis
* Wrote [SQL Queries](https://github.com/anulkar/sql-challenge/blob/master/EmployeeSQL/employee_db_queries.sql) to answer questions about the data.
* [This jupyter notebook](https://github.com/anulkar/sql-challenge/blob/master/EmployeeSQL/employee_db_analysis.ipynb) shows a visualization of the most common salary ranges for employees and average salary by title.
